## Installing

Download `AcidBubbles.Timeline.(version).var` from [Releases](https://github.com/acidbubbles/vam-timeline/releases) and put it into the `(VaM)/AddonPackages` folder. For versions before VaM 1.19, you can extract the `.var` file into your VaM install folder (so the files end up in `(VaM Install Folder)/Custom/Scripts/Acidbubbles/Timeline`).

## Documentation

Head to the [wiki](https://github.com/acidbubbles/vam-timeline/wiki) for instructions.

## Contributing

Contribution are welcome. This is a complex plugin with, sadly, no unit or automated tests, so reach out before developing anything complex, and validate often that you're on the right track.

The paths to the VaM dll files in the `.csproj` file are relative, so clone into `(VaM Install Folder)/Custom/Scripts/Dev/vam-timeline` for example.
