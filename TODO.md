# Vam Timeline TODOs

- Undo / Redo
- Auto-save
- Move keyframes (all keyframes together)
- Toggle Add/Remove controller instead of using two buttons
- Choose whether to loop, ping pong, or play once
- Trigger on animation complete / on keyframes
- Autoplay on load
- Animate morphs
- Attach triggers to the animation (maybe sync with an animation pattern for scrubbing?)
- Animate any property (physics, scale, etc.)
- Define animation transitions using built-in unity animation blending
- Copy/paste frame (all controllers in frame)
- Delete keyframes
- When locked, disable all controls
- Speed should be at the clip level
- Move the "current clip" inside the clip for faster access
- Speed is not saved
- Improve naming of animation (guid?)
- Bring controllers when creating new animations
- Make a UI that actually changes based on the selection (like tabs, one to configure animation, one to scrub, one to modify keyframes...)
